## Disclaimer

The watch reports its revision as E3.628 (dated 2014/06/30). This can be seen from watch "Infor" menu. It is very much possible
the protocol described here, and the utility itself work with other versions of the watch. However, obviously as the protocol have been reverse engineered by monitoring the transferred data I cannot give any guarantees. Nor I cannot give any sort of guarantees, that the software do not make any harm to your watch. Use at your own risk!
