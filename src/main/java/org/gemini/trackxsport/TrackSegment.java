/**
 * {@code TrackSegment} represents an ordered list of logically connected
 * {@link Waypoint Waypoints}. For example, {@code TrackSegment} may be
 * a list of waypoints between start, stop or laps of an exercise. Other
 * possible use is a case where the GPS signal is lost for a while, in which
 * case the {@code Waypoints} may be ordered into two separate {@code
 * TrackSegments}.
 * 
 * <p>In case of GD-003, a {@code TrackSegment} represents a list of
 * waypoints embeded into a single block of data received from the
 * device. It's a bit unclear, if this behaviour in GD-003 is related to e.g.
 * loss of GPS-signal, or just a practicality of avoiding huge blocks of
 * data across serial line... (TODO: investigate different blcoks a bit...)
 * 
 * <p>An instance of this type is primarily instantiated by
 * {@link Track#segments()}, e.g:
 * 
 * <pre><tt> 
 *  final Track track = ...
 *  final Iterator<TrackSegment> segments = track.segments();}
 * </tt></pre>
 * 
 * <h1>GD-003 Protocol</h1>
 * 
 * When requesting a track (refer to {@link Track}), the device replies
 * at least one, but usually several data packages, each representing a 
 * {@code TrackSegment}. So far haven't found a way to know all packages
 * have been read, except waiting a bit before giving up. Reading is
 * done in {@link Track#getTrack(jssc.SerialPort, long)}.
 * 
 * <p>There's some evidence, that at least occasionally, the last message
 * sent by the device contains the following bytes or part of it:
 * 
 * <pre><tt>
 *   0x48 0x59 0x01 0x00 0x02 0x00 0x03 0x02 0x08 0x16
 * </pre></tt>
 * 
 * <p>The content of each segment package:
 * <pre><tt>
 *  | offset | type   | description
 *  |--------|--------|------------------------
 *  | 0x00   | byte   | fixed 'H' (0x48)
 *  | 0x01   | byte   | fixed 'Y' (0x59)
 *  | 0x02   | byte   | fixed 0x03 ("request family")
 *  | 0x03   | byte   | fixed 0x02 ("get track")
 *  | 0x04   | uint16 | data length (data begins at offset 0x06, checksum
 *  |                   bytes excluded.
 *  | 0x06   | byte   | track identifier
 *  | 0x08   | byte   | segment number
 *  | 0x0a   | uint16 | number of waypoints in this segment.
 *  | 0x26   |        | offset of first waypoint. See {@link Waypoint}.
 *  |        | byte   | checksum, unknown algorithm, currently not verified
 *  |        | byte   | checksum, unknown algorithm
 * </tt></pre>
